# Euro Trip

## Introduction
First Live Project focusing mainly on Python, Django Framework, and CRUD 
In this live project I experienced my first sprint sessions, daily standups, working with Azure, and working in a DevOps team. 
We were allowed to choose our own topic, I chose **Euro Trip** as I have always been fascinated with traveling. In this readme
I will discuss specific programming languages I used, what I accomplished, what led me to those accomplishments, what I plan to 
do in the future with this project, etc.
<br><br>
This project was created to help travellers to Europe. The project uses an API to convert currencies, has a form with fields pertaining to travel for users to fill 
out that can be stored in a dB, the app querries data from users and renders on the page what has been posted about different cities, users also have the ability
to create and delete entries, updating the dB. <br>
**Disclaimer: The pictures posted for this project only display example input and in no way does it reflect the author's feelings concerning individual cities or countries.**

## Create
